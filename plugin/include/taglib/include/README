These are only necessary at build-time when building the entire kdesupport module; they do not need to be installed on a running system.

It can be regenerated by using something like the following from the taglib/taglib directory:

for file in `find -type f -name "*\.h"`;
do 
  dir=`dirname $file`
  strippeddir=`echo $dir | cut -c 3-`
  base=`basename $file`
  if test -z $strippeddir
  then
    echo "#include \"../taglib/$base\"" > ../include/$base
  else
    echo "#include \"../taglib/$strippeddir/$base\"" > ../include/$base
  fi
done
