TagLib Installation
===================

TagLib uses the CMake build system. As a user, you will most likely want to
build TagLib in release mode and install it into a system-wide location.
This can be done using the following commands:

  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local -DCMAKE_RELEASE_TYPE=Release .
  make
  sudo make install

Some file formats in TagLib are not enabled by default, you can compile
support for MP4 and WMA using the following options:

  cmake -DWITH_MP4=ON -DWITH_ASF=ON [...]

If you want to run the test suite to make sure TagLib works properly on your
system, you need to have cppunit installed. The test suite has a custom target
in the build system, so you can run the tests using make:

  make check

See http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/runningcmake.html for generic help on
running CMake.
